    <p>in New York City to Jamaican parents, But bouncing from place to place due to rough circumstances at home.
        JPEGMAFIA or “Peggy” as known by his fans, spent most of his childhood in Brooklyn, NY before relocating in his
        mid-teens to deep southern Alabama & dealing with racism head on.</p> 

    <p>After graduating high school, JPEG joined the United States military, deploying to different parts of the world,
        before becoming a participant in the War in Iraq. These circumstances added new elements to his producing and
        rapping repertoire, which he takes on alone writing, recording, producing, mixing & mastering all of his own
        music. Now based in Los Angeles, JPEGMAFIA’s sound is dark but not without a humor that makes things even more
        uncomfortable. His role as villain or satirist, hood protector or nihilist is intentionally hard to put one’s
        finger on.</p>
