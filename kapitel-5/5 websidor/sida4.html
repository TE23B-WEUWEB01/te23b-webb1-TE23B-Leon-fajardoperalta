        <p>Ye[a] (/jeɪ/ YAY; born Kanye Omari West /ˈkɑːnjeɪ/ KAHN-yay; June 8, 1977) is an American rapper and
            record producer. One of the most prominent figures in hip hop,[3] he is known for his varying musical
            style[4] and polarizing cultural and political commentary.[5] After dropping out of college to pursue a
            career in music, West began producing for regional artists in the Chicago area. As an in-house producer
            for Roc-A-Fella Records, he co-produced albums including Jay-Z's The Blueprint (2001) before signing
            with the label as a recording artist. West's debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), was met
            with critical acclaim and yielded the Billboard Hot 100-number one single "Slow Jamz". He peaked the
            chart on four other occasions with the singles "Gold Digger" (2005), "Stronger" (2007), "E.T." (2011, as
            a featured artist), and "Carnival" (2024).</p>
