        <p>Rakim Athelaston Mayers[2] (born October 3, 1988), known professionally as A$AP Rocky (/ˈeɪsæp/ AY-sap;
            stylized as A$AP Rocky), is an American-Barbadian rapper.[3] Born and raised in Harlem, he embarked on
            his musical career as a member of the hip hop collective ASAP Mob, from which he adopted his moniker. In
            August 2011, Mayers' single "Peso" was leaked online, and within weeks, began receiving radio
            airplay.[4] He signed with Polo Grounds Music, an imprint of RCA Records in October of that year, and
            shortly after, released his debut mixtape, Live. Love. A$AP (2011) to widespread critical acclaim.[5][6]
