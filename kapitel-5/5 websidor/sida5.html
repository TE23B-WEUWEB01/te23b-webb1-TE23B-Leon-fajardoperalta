        <p>Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and
            philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons
            of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his vast contributions to music, dance and fashion,
            along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced
            artists across a variety of musical styles. Through his decorative singing and visual presentation, he
            popularized street dance moves such as the moonwalk, which he named, the robot, and the anti-gravity
            lean.</p>
